<h1>Software development</h1>

<h2>R packages</h2>

I have a good experience developing software, in particular in the last decade I worked several 
projects employing R and Python, as result I created some packages and libraries.

<ol>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/mau">mau</a> An R package for design and test of 
multi-criteria decision models employing Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT).</li>

<li> <a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/KRIG">KRIG</a> An R package implemented with Rcpp 
and RcppArmadillo. Spatial statistics methods all based on Kriging. It includes functional analysis 
of variance (FANOVA).</li>

<li> <a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/CFINI">CFINI</a> An R package currently under 
development, implemented with Rcpp. It will provide  different computational finance algorithms. As 
novelty this package includes a pricing method with n-ary trees.</li>

</ol>

<h2>C++ libraries</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/CAG">CAG</a> Basic algebraic geometry template 
library developed with C++ based complete on the standard library.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/KRIGA">KRIGA</a> Elementary C++ kringing library 
implemented over the Global Arrays library (currently outdated).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Others</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/leonardovelez/RiskoNIC19">Risko NIC19</a> a complete project for 
the estimation of reserves for employee benefits under the prescription of the International 
Accounting Standards IAS19.
</li>

<li> 
Risko A package with different actuarial tools, parallel simulation of continuous Markov processes, 
premium estimation of individual and collective risk models and reserves computations.
</li>
</ol>
