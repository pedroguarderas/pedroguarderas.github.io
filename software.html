<h1>Software development</h1>

<h2>R packages</h2>

I have a good experience developing software, in particular in the last decade I worked several 
projects employing R and Python, as result I created some packages and libraries.

<ol>
<li> mau R package for design and test of multi-criteria decision models employing Multi-Attribute 
Utility Theory (MAUT).</li>

<li> KRIG R package implemented with Rcpp and RcppArmadillo. Spatial statistics methods all based 
on Kriging. It includes functional analysis of variance (FANOVA).</li>

<li>CFINI R package currently under development, implemented with Rcpp. It will provide  different 
computational finance algorithms. As novelty this package includes a pricing method with n-ary 
trees.</li>

<li>Risko R package with actuarial tools, parallel simulation of continuous Markov processes, 
premium estimation of individual and collective risk models and reserves computations.</li>
</ol>

<h2>C++ libraries</h2>
<ol>
<li>CAG Basic algebraic geometry template library developed with C++ based complete on the standard 
library.</li>

<li>KRIGA Elementary C++ kringing library implemented over the Global Arrays library (currently 
outdated).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Others</h2>
<ol>
<li>Risko NIC19 a complete project for the estimation of reserves for employee benefits under the 
prescription of the International Accounting Standards IAS19.</li>
</ol>
