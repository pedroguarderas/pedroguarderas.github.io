    "text": "Introduction\nMy research interests are focused on two distinct areas:\n\nThe emerging interplay between optimization and geometry, particularly in the development of geometric interpretations of optimization methods and the discovery of new invariants.\nThe design of actuarial models, with a particular emphasis on developing novel stochastic approaches for the analysis and valuation of different insurance products.\n\nMy primary research focus began with the design of mathematical models, where I applied optimization methods to a variety of problems. Initially, my work emphasized the application of well-established results to estimate complex statistical models. However, over time, my interests evolved from applied problems to more theoretical questions, particularly those with foundational consequences across other areas of mathematics. I now pay special attention to the geometric interpretation of optimization methods and the development of new invariants, especially those arising in enumeration and related geometric problems.\nAt a certain point, I chose to diversify my career path in mathematics, which led to the emergence of my second research interest. During this period, I also gained valuable and relatively uncommon experience working as an actuary. I devoted significant effort to researching, designing, integrating, and implementing mathematical models with applications in insurance and finance. Notably, I contributed to the development and implementation of various valuation models for pension funds, as well as other products within the insurance sector.\nMy professional experience as a mathematician has been closely tied to the implementation of mathematical models. For further details, I invite you to visit my GitHub profile , where I have shared a variety of projects. These range from completed works to others currently in progress, and they reflect different aspects of my research and applied work."
