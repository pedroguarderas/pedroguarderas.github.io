<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My interests of research are focused in two dissimilar subjects.</p>

<ol>
<li> I am interested in the emerging interactions between optimization and geometry.</li>
<li> I am interested in the conception of actuarial models specifically looking for new 
mathematical methods for the study of pension funds.</li>
</ol> 

<p>
The first is my main research subject, I started to work designing mathematical models employing in 
several cases optimization methods; I was focused to only employ well know results to the 
estimation of complex statistical models, however my interest changed from applications to 
theoretical problems and fundamental consequences impacting another areas in Mathematics, in 
particular I try to study and comprehend geometrical interpretations of optimization methods and 
the computation and design of new algebraic invariants related to enumerative problems in geometry.

<p>
Time ago, I decided to bifurcate the path of my career as mathematician; as consequence my 
second research interest emerged, during this time I also gained a good and quite unique experience 
working for <a href="https://www.webrisko.com/">Risko S.A.</a> a risk management enterprise. In 
these years, I concentrated a good part of my energy to research, conceive, design, integrate and 
implement several mathematical models with actuarial applications. In particular, jointly with the 
actuarial team of Risko S.A. we have implemented several valuation models for pension funds, health 
insurance and other products inside the insurance industry.
</p>

<p>
My work experience as mathematician has been related to the implementation of mathematical 
models, for additional details you can check 
<a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/">my github</a> profile where I decided to version 
several projects with different purposes, some of then finished, others in working progress.
