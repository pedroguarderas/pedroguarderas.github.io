<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My main interests of research are focused in two dissimilar subjects.</p>

<ol>
<li> I am interested in the emerging interactions between optimization, combinatorics, algebra, 
geometry and algorithms.</li>
<li> I am interested in the generation of actuarial models with better prediction, specifically 
looking for applications to the study of pension funds.</li>
</ol> 

<p>The first is my kind academic and theoric related interest, it is related to my graduated 
formation and research. I studied optimization for estimation of complex statistical models, 
generation of quality measures to effectively simulate an assembly process and investigate new 
methods for the implementation of quantum mechanical models related to Density Functional Theory 
and generalizations.</p>

<p>Time ago, I decided to bifurcate the path of my career as mathematician; as consequence my 
second research interest emerged, during this time I gained a good and quite unique experience 
working for <a href="https://www.webrisko.com/">Risko S.A.</a> an actuarial and risk management 
enterprise. In these years, I concentrated my energy to research, conceive, design, integrate and 
implement several mathematical models with actuarial applications. In particular, jointly with the 
actuarial team of Risko S.A. we have implemented several valuation models for pension funds and 
other insurance products inside the social security.
</p>

<p>My working experience as professional mathematician has been always related to the 
implementation of mathematical models, you can check 
<a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/">my github</a> profile where I decided to version 
several projects with different purposes, some of then finished, others in working progress.
