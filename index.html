<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My main interests of research are focused in two dissimilar subjects.</p>

<ol>
<li> I am interested in the emerging interactions between optimization and geometry where several
methods are related to combinatorics, algebra and theory of algorithms.</li>
<li> I am interested in the generation of actuarial models with better prediction, specifically 
looking for new mathematical methods for the study of pension funds.</li>
</ol> 

<p>
The first is my main research subject, where I am mostly interested in the theoretical results 
and fundamental consequences impacting another research areas in mathematics. I started to work
in Optimization, as a final user, only employing the well know results to the estimation complex 
statistical models, however my interest growths in interest from the applications to theoretical 
results and impacting others areas of mathematics, in particular the geometrical interpretations
and consequences and the discovery and computation of new algebraic invariants.

<p>
Time ago, I decided to bifurcate the path of my career as mathematician; as consequence my 
second research interest emerged, during this time I gained a good and quite unique experience 
working for <a href="https://www.webrisko.com/">Risko S.A.</a> a risk management enterprise. In 
these years, I concentrated a good part of my energy to research, conceive, design, integrate and 
implement several mathematical models with actuarial applications. In particular, jointly with the 
actuarial team of Risko S.A. we have implemented several valuation models for pension funds and 
other insurance products inside the insurance industry.
</p>

<p>
My work experience as mathematician has been always related to the implementation of mathematical 
models, you can check <a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/">my github</a> profile where I 
decided to version several projects with different purposes, some of then finished, others in 
working progress.
