  title: Valuation of social security funds
  client: Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (IESS)
  description: Actuarial consultancy for the design and implementation of several actuarial models 
    for the valuation of reserves and solvency of social security. We designed a collaborative R 
    project, to process massive information, estimate transition rates, smooth estimated rates, 
    dynamic mortality modeling, macroeconomic modeling and demographic projections. All methods were 
    integrated to estimate mathematical reserves under different scenarios. You will find the 
    results of theses studies <a href="https://www.iess.gob.ec/es/web/guest/estudios-actuariales-2020">here</a>.
