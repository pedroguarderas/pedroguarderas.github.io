  title: Valuation of social security funds
  client: Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (IESS)
  description: Actuarial consultancy for the design and implementation of several actuarial models 
    for the valuation of reserves and solvency of social security. We designed a collaborative R 
    project, to process massive information, estimate transition rates, smooth estimated rates, 
    dynamic mortality modeling, macroeconomic modeling and demographic projections. All methods were 
    integrated to estimate mathematical reserves under different scenarios.

  title: Administrative expenses optimization
  client: Zurich Insurance
  description: Creation of a linear programming model for the optimal assignation of non 
    distributed expenses to different lines of business. Improvement of the constitution of 
    reserves due to inadequacy of premiums.
