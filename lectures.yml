  description: These notes are based on the outstanding course “NCCR SwissMAP Master Class in 
    Geometry, Topology and Physics” delivered by Anton Alekseev. This subject has long been a personal 
    passion of mine, and I decided to develop these lectures because I believe the concepts and ideas
    presented are exceptional. To my knowledge, there is no comparable book or lecture series that 
    integrates these topics in such a unified and comprehensive manner.
