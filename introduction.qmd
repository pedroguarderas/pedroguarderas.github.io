# Introduction

My research interests are focused on two distinct areas:

  - The emerging interplay between optimization and geometry, particularly in the development of 
  geometric interpretations of optimization methods and the discovery of new invariants.

  - The design of actuarial models, with a particular emphasis on developing novel stochastic
  approaches for the analysis and valuation of different insurance products.

My primary research focus began with the design of mathematical models, where I applied optimization 
methods to a variety of problems. Initially, my work emphasized the application of well-established 
results to estimate complex statistical models. However, over time, my interests evolved from 
applied problems to more theoretical questions, particularly those with foundational consequences 
across other areas of mathematics. I now pay special attention to the geometric interpretation of 
optimization methods and the development of new invariants, especially those arising in enumeration 
and related geometric problems.

At a certain point, I chose to diversify my career path in mathematics, which led to the emergence 
of my second research interest. During this period, I also gained valuable and relatively uncommon 
experience working as an actuary. I devoted significant effort to researching, designing, 
integrating, and implementing mathematical models with applications in insurance and finance. 
Notably, I contributed to the development and implementation of various valuation models for 
pension funds, as well as other products within the insurance sector.

My professional experience as a mathematician has been closely tied to the implementation of 
mathematical models. For further details, I invite you to visit my
<a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/">GitHub profile</a> , where I have shared a variety of 
projects. These range from completed works to others currently in progress, and they reflect 
different aspects of my research and applied work.
