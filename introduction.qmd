# Introduction

My research interests are focused on two distinct areas:

  - The emerging interplay between optimization and geometry, particularly in the development of 
  geometric interpretations of optimization methods and the discovery of new invariants.

  - The design of actuarial models, with a particular emphasis on developing novel stochastic
  approaches for the creation on innovative tools for risk management.

My primary research focus began with the design of mathematical models, where I applied optimization 
methods to a variety of problems. Initially, my work emphasized the application of well-established 
results to estimate complex statistical models. However, over time, my interests evolved from 
applied problems to more theoretical questions, particularly those with foundational consequences 
across other areas of mathematics. with special attention to the geometric interpretation of 
optimization methods and the development of new invariants, especially those arising in enumeration 
and related geometric problems.

At a certain point in my career, I made a deliberate decision to diversify my path within the field 
of Mathematics, which gave rise to a second line of research. During this time, I also acquired 
valuable and relatively uncommon experience as both an actuary and a quant. I dedicated substantial 
effort to researching, designing, integrating, and implementing mathematical models for applications 
in insurance and finance. Notably, I contributed to the development and deployment of various 
valuation models for pension funds and other insurance products. Building on this foundation, I 
later expanded my focus to the study and implementation of innovative tools for risk management.

My professional experience as a mathematician has been closely tied to the implementation of 
mathematical models. For further details, I invite you to visit my
<a href="https://github.com/pedroguarderas/">GitHub profile</a> , where I have shared a variety of 
projects. These range from completed works to others currently in progress, and they reflect 
different aspects of my research and applied work.
